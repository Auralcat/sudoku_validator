# SudokuValidator

From the [challenge repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot-upcase-exercises/sudoku-validator):

> Sudoku is a logic-based combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

> Write a command-line program that can read a file containing a Sudoku grid and validates it. The grid can be partially or completely solved. Return either a success message or a list of errors and their positions.
